Project 18: Quantifying entanglement with Neural Networks
By Group 132
  Artur Mazurkiewicz (s215146)

Languages used: PYTHON and MATLAB.

In DATA_GEN there are MATLAB files, which rely on QETLAB, for generating different entangled datasets.
  Included PYTHON code for checking entanglement of the generated dataset.

In NN there are PYTHON files, sadly without interactive notebook (unfortunatelly I have certain problems with running libraries on my processor :( ), with code for architecture sweep on the generated datset.

In PLOTS there are PYTHON files with code to generate plots - which can be found in further directory PNGS and in my report on DTU Learn.
